I'm in it for the money.What!? Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. I call it luck. Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. Red Five standing by. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.I don't know what you're talking about.

The Force is with him. I find your lack of faith disturbing. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. What?! Partially, but it also obeys your commands. Ye-ha! I'm trying not to, kid.Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.

There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.
